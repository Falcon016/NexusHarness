# Configuration

You rarely need to edit these files by hand: `nexus setup` asks a few questions and writes the user config (and stores
your API key separately). See [install.md](install.md#the-setup-wizard). This page is the reference.

## Where config lives

| Layer   | Path                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User    | Linux `~/.config/nexusharness/config.json` · macOS `~/Library/Application Support/nexusharness/config.json` · Windows `%APPDATA%\nexusharness\config.json` |
| Project | `.nexusharness/config.json` in the project (or any parent directory)                                                                                       |
| Env     | `NEXUS_MODEL`, `NEXUS_APPROVAL`, `NEXUS_SANDBOX`                                                                                                           |
| Flags   | `--model`, `--approval`, `--sandbox`, `--no-browser`                                                                                                       |

Later layers win. List settings (`rules`, `denyPaths`, `allowPaths`, `allowedHosts`, `blockedHosts`, `agents`) are
concatenated; objects are merged. Set `NEXUS_HOME` to relocate everything (config/data/state) — handy for tests and
containers. `nexus doctor` prints what it found.

**Project config is untrusted by default.** Until you run `nexus trust` in the project, only these are applied:
`model`, `theme`, `deny`/`ask` approval rules, extra `sandbox.denyPaths`, `browser.blockedHosts`. Everything else
(including `approval.mode`, allow rules, `sandbox.mode`, `mcpServers`, `providers`) is ignored with a warning, and the
project's skills, extensions, prompt templates and `SYSTEM.md` are not loaded.

## Providers

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "unsloth": { "type": "openai", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1" },
    "openrouter": {
      "type": "openai",
      "baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "apiKeyEnv": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Anything that speaks OpenAI's `/chat/completions` streaming protocol works (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server,
Unsloth Studio...). Local `localhost` endpoints need no key. The context window is read from the server (llama.cpp `--ctx-size` via the
router's `/v1/models`, or `/props`; LM Studio; Ollama `/api/ps`). If it is not reported, 32,768 tokens is assumed and
you get a warning: set the size with `/context <tokens>` (saved as `contextWindows`), or the provider's `contextWindow`, so
compaction triggers at the right size.

### `/login` and `/logout`

`/login` connects a provider from inside the terminal UI, after [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)'s:

- **Pick a provider.** The list shows the built-in ones and any you added, with where each points, whether a key is
  saved (or comes from an environment variable) and which one is in use. **Add another server…** adds one of your
  own under a short name (its models become `<name>/<model>`). `/login llamacpp` skips the list.
- **Cloud providers** (Anthropic, OpenAI) ask for an API key, shown as dots. Leave it empty to keep the one you have.
- **Local and added servers** ask for the address, pre-filled with the current one: edit it, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>
  and type a new one. If the server answers 401 you are asked for its key (`llama-server --api-key`).
- **Everything is checked before it is saved**, by asking the provider for its models. A refused key saves nothing;
  a server that does not answer can be saved anyway (for one you will start later).
- It saves the address to your user `config.json` (the built-in address is not written down) and the key to
  `auth.json` with owner-only permissions, then offers the provider's models. A model in use from that provider
  switches to the new address straight away.

`/logout` removes a saved key, and for a server you added, can forget the server too. Keys from environment variables
are not touched. Subscription logins (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT) are not supported: use an API key.

Built-in providers: `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama` (:11434), `lmstudio` (:1234), `llamacpp` (:8080). Ollama's default
port is also 11434, so if you run llama.cpp there, override `providers.llamacpp.baseUrl` and use the `llamacpp/` prefix. Tool calling must be supported by the model/server you pick.

## Instructions, skills, templates

- `AGENTS.md` / `NEXUSHARNESS.md`: read from the config dir and every directory from `/` down to the working directory.
- `SYSTEM.md` in the config dir (or a trusted project's `.nexusharness/`) replaces the built-in system prompt.
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` front-matter: listed to the model, loaded on demand. Other
  files in the skill's folder (playbooks, scripts, templates) are listed when it loads and read with the skill tool's
  `file` argument, so a large skill costs context only for the parts a task uses; reads stay inside the folder. A
  user or project skill with the same name replaces a built-in one. `/skills` lists them. Built in:

  | Skill               | For                                                                                   |
  | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `it-admin`          | Sysadmin work on Linux, Windows, macOS: read-only snapshot scripts and nine playbooks |
  | `debugging`         | Reproduce, narrow down, fix the cause and prove it                                    |
  | `pr-review`         | Review a pull request or branch with findings by severity                             |
  | `pre-commit-review` | Run the checks, read the diff, write the commit message                               |
  | `security-review`   | Secrets, injection, auth and dependency checks with severities                        |
  | `simplify`          | Go back over recent changes: reuse, remove waste, keep behaviour                      |
  | `webapp-testing`    | Test a running web app through the browser tools or Playwright                        |
  | `frontend-design`   | UI with a deliberate visual direction and solid basics                                |
  | `documents`         | PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint files with Python (notes per format)                  |
  | `mcp-builder`       | Build an MCP server and connect it                                                    |
  | `python-env`        | Find and repair a Python environment                                                  |
  | `init`              | Write or refresh `AGENTS.md`                                                          |
  | `resume-work`       | Pick up earlier work from saved conversations, checked against the project            |
  | `skill-creator`     | Write a new skill                                                                     |

- Saved conversations: every session is a JSONL file under `<data>/sessions/<project>/`. The agent's `sessions`
  tool lists, searches (tool output included) and reads them, this folder's by default or every folder's with
  `scope: "all"`; it is read-only, hides secrets it finds, and marks what it returns as data. `nexus -c` and
  `/resume [id]` bring a conversation back on screen; `/flush` deletes old ones.
- `prompts/<name>.md` → `/name`; `$ARGUMENTS` and `$1`…`$9` are substituted.
- `extensions/*.{ts,js}`: see the README and [examples/extensions](../examples/extensions).
